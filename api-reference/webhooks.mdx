## Using Webhooks

to use a webhook, specify the `webhookUrl` parameter when using any of our API endpoints that allow it.

once your job completes or fails, a `POST` request will be sent to the `webhookUrl` with the details of the completed job:

```json
{
  "result": data,
  "error": "Error message",
}
```

<Note>Ensure your webhook URL is open to `POST` requests and properly handles them.</Note>

data will be returned regardless of the status of the job. the `error` field will return null if the job completed successfully.

the data returned will match the format of the corresponding `get` request for the job. for example, if you use the `/lipsync/` endpoint, the data returned will match the format of the `/lipsync/{id}/` endpoint.

webhooks simplify your workflow by eliminating the need for frequent status inquiries. you can continue other tasks while waiting for a webhook notification.
