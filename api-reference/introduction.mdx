## welcome
welcome to our api documentation. we provide a suite of apis that allow you to manipulate and synthesize video and audio content with state-of-the-art (sota) models. whether you're looking to lipsync videos, animate static images, translate content across languages, or generate natural-sounding speech, our apis are designed to make these tasks simple and efficient.

our apis are perfect for developers working on projects in content creation, localization, accessibility, and more. with just a few requests, you can enhance your video content, making it more engaging and accessible to a global audience.

getting started is easy. all you need is an `x-api-key` to authenticate your requests. from there, you can explore our various api endpoints, each tailored to specific video and audio processing needs. check out the openapi spec for a detailed description of available operations.

## base url

our apis adhere to REST principles and prioritize security, integrity, and privacy by enforcing HTTPS on all requests. start your requests with our base URL and explore the possibilities.

all requests start w/ the following base URL:

```
https://api.synclabs.so
```

## security and authentication

all our api endpoints expect an `x-api-key` header in every request. 
it's a simple + secure way to authenticate your requests / generate accurate usage metrics across your api keys.

here's how you can include it in your requests:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.synclabs.so/lipsync",
  "headers": {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "your_api_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "audioUrl": "https://example.com/path-to-audio.mp3",
    "videoUrl": "https://example.com/path-to-video.mp4",
    "synergize": true,
    "maxCredits": null,
    "webhookUrl": null,
    "model": "sync-1.6.0"
  }
}
```
