## base url

our apis are built on REST principles. we enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy.

all requests start w/ the following base URL:

```
https://api.synclabs.so
```

all video API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.


## security and authentication

all our api endpoints expect an `x-api-key` header in every request. 
it's a simple + secure way to authenticate your requests / generate accurate usage metrics across your api keys.

here's how you can include it in your requests:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.synclabs.so/video",
  "headers": {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "your_api_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "audioUrl": "https://example.com/path-to-audio.mp3",
    "videoUrl": "https://example.com/path-to-video.mp4",
    "synergize": true,
    "maxCredits": 10,
    "webhookUrl": "https://example.com/webhook",
    "model": "sync-1.5.0"
  }
}

```
