## getting started with sync.
welcome to the sync. quickstart guide! here, we'll guide you through creating an account in our web app, generating your first api key, and making your initial request using the `/lipsync` endpoint.

the `/lipsync` endpoint allows you to synchronize your videos' lip movements with any audio track, enhancing accessibility, engagement, and overall video quality. follow the steps below to seamlessly integrate cutting-edge lip-sync technology into your projects.


## create an account in the web app
to kickstart your journey with our apis, the first step is to create an account on our [web app](https://app.synclabs.so). this simple process allows you to obtain an api key, manage your account, and access our apis.


## generate an api-key

after signing up a new api key is automatically generated for you and can be accessed from the [keys page of the web app](https://app.synclabs.so/keys).

you can also create new api keys and manage existing ones at any time from the same [page](https://app.synclabs.so/keys).

## generate your first video using the api

once you have your `x-api-key`, you're ready to synchronize your first video using the `/lipsync` endpoint. to sync your video via the [playground](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/endpoint/lipsync/post-lipsync) follow the instructions below:


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="book" title="lipsync your video via the api playground">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="authorize">
      enter your api key in the `x-api-key` field within the `Authorization` section.

      <Frame caption={`enter your x-api-key in the authorization section`}>
        <img src="/images/lipsync/lipsync-authorize.png" alt="authorize lipsync api" />
      </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="enter params">
      enter the params in the body section:

      <Frame caption={`
        enter the urls for your publicly accessible audio and video files into the respective fields and set other required parameters.
      `}>
        <img src="/images/lipsync/lipsync-body.png" alt="body params for lipsync api" />
      </Frame>
      <h3>example input</h3>
      ```json
      {
        "audioUrl": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
        "videoUrl": "https://example.com/video.mp4",
        "synergize": true,
        "model": "sync-1.6.0"
      }
      ```
      
    </Step>
      <Step title="submit">
      click the `Send` button to submit your synchronization request. after submission, you will receive a response that includes the `id` of your lip-sync job, the current status, and URLs to the original submissions.

      <h3>understanding the response</h3>
      the initial response provides you with essential details to track your job:

      ```json
      {
        "id": "unique_job_id",
        "status": "processing",
        "videoUrl": "",
        "originalVideoUrl": "https://example.com/video.mp4",
        "originalAudioUrl": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
        "synergize": true,
        "creditsDeducted": 123,
        "webhookUrl": null,
      }
      ```

      your job's `status` will start as `pending` and move to `processing`. use the returned `id` with the `GET /lipsync/{id}` endpoint to periodically poll for the status of your job. this polling is crucial for knowing when your video is ready.

      <h3>polling for completion</h3>
      periodically send requests to `GET /lipsync/{id}` with your job `id`. when the job status changes to `completed`, the response will include a URL to download your synced video.

      Click [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/endpoint/lipsync/get-lipsync#quick-start) to view instructions on polling for job completion with the [get lipsync api playground](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/endpoint/lipsync/get-lipsync)
