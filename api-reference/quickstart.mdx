## generate an api-key
all our api endpoints expect an X-API-Key header in every request. 
it's a simple + secure way to authenticate your requests / generate accurate usage metrics across your api keys.

TODO:
show where to find a key
show how to make / destroy a key
FUTURE -> see usage metrics across keys // eg. # of calls, # of mins generated, etc.

## [POST] make your first request

TODO:
show how the request is structured
show

## [GET] poll for a response


## Security and Authentication

To secure our video API endpoints, we employ X-API-Key authentication. 
This method is chosen to facilitate a seamless and secure integration process for all client-server communications.
