you can also create new api keys and manage existing ones at any time from the same [page](https://app.synclabs.so/keys).

## create your first job with the api

the easiest way to start testing out the api is with the [API reference](/api-reference).

 watch the video and follow the steps below to get started with the api.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="navigate to the api reference">
        visit the [API reference](/api-reference) to get started with the lip-sync api. the api reference provides a comprehensive guide to the endpoints and parameters available for syncing your audio and video.

        we'll be playing around with the `POST /video` lip-sync endpoint which you can find [here](/api-reference/endpoint/video/post-lip-sync).
      </Step>
      <Step title="setup authorization">
        provide your `x-api-key` for authentication to access the api. you'll need this for all requests to create and manage your lip-sync jobs. to manage your api keys, visit the [keys page](https://app.synclabs.so/keys) in the web app or checkout the instructions in the [get your api key](/quickstart#get-your-api-key) section above

        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="enter body parameters">
        fill out the body parameters with the details of your lip-sync job. you'll provide URLs to the audio and video you want to sync, and set a few options to tailor the job to your needs.
        
        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/use-api-reference/enter-body-params.png" alt="enter api key" />

        <Expandable title="body params" defaultOpen>
          <ResponseField name="audioUrl" type="string">
            The URL for the audio file to sync. Ensure it is either a YouTube URL or publicly accessible and in `mp3` or `wav` format.
          </ResponseField>
          <ResponseField name="videoUrl" type="string">
            The URL for the video file to be lip-synced. It should be a YouTube URL or publicly accessible `mp4` file.
          </ResponseField>
          <ResponseField name="synergize" type="boolean">
            A flag to enable / disable post-processing
          </ResponseField>
          <ResponseField name="maxCredits" type="number">
            Maximum number of credits to use for video generation. If the job exceeds this value, the job will be aborted
          </ResponseField>
          <ResponseField name="webhookUrl" type="string">
            A URL to send a notification to upon completion of video generation
          </ResponseField>
          <ResponseField name="model" type="string">
            The model to use for video generation
          </ResponseField>
        </Expandable>

        ensure all the required fields are filled out correctly to avoid any errors with your request. with everything set, you're ready to submit your job and let our synchronizer work its magic.
      </Step>
      <Step title="check job status">
        after submitting your `POST` request, you'll receive a job `id`. use this `id` to make a `GET` request to `/video/{id}` and check the status of your lip-sync job.

        keep polling until the status is `completed` and you receive a URL to download your synced video.
      </Step>
      <Step title="download your video">
        once the job status is `completed`, use the provided download URL to retrieve your synced video.

        now, your content is ready to amaze with perfect lip-sync, all powered by the sync api.
