# introduction

after initiating a voice synthesis job, use the `/voices/{id}` endpoint to stay updated on its progress and to retrieve the synthesized audio.

this guide helps you navigate the tracking process, ensuring you're always informed about your job's progress.

# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## monitor your voice synthesis jobs

with an `x-api-key`, following the progress of your voice synthesis is easy. to check your job's status via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/voices/get-voice), follow these instructions:

      <Step title="secure your job id">
        upon sending your request for voice synthesis via the `/voices` endpoint, you will receive a job `id`. keep this id for tracking.

      </Step>
      <Step title="verify job status">
        use the `id` to query the `/voices/{id}` endpoint periodically. this keeps you informed about your job's progress towards completion.

      <Step title="access your audio">
        when the job status updates to `completed`, the response will provide a url to download your synthesized voice audio.
