# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## explore available voices

with your `x-api-key` ready, you have everything you need to discover and choose the right voice for your project. to sync your video via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/voices/get-voices) follow the instructions below:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="authorize">
        enter your api key in the `x-api-key` field within the `Authorization` section.

        <Frame caption={`enter your x-api-key in the authorization section`}>

        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="submit">
        click the `Send` button to submit your synchronization request. after submission, you will receive a response that includes the `id` of your lip-sync job, the current status, and URLs to the original submissions.

        <h3>understanding the response</h3>
        the initial response provides you with essential details to track your job:

        ```json
        [
          {
            "id": "unique_job_id",
            "status": "completed",
            "name": "voice_name",
            "description": "voice_description",
            "inputSamples": ["https://example.com/sample1.mp3"],
            "outputSamples": ["https://example.com/sample1.mp3"],
          }
          ...
        ]
        ```

        examine the list to find a voice that suits your project's needs. look for the `id`, `name`, and `status`, and `outputSamples` of each voice to make your selection.
