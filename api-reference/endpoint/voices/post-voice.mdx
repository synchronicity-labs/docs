# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## create your custom voice

with your `x-api-key` ready, you can begin creating custom voice clones. to use the `/voices` via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/voices/post-voice) follow the instructions below:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="microphone" title="create a custom voice via the api">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="authorize">
        enter your api key in the `x-api-key` field within the `Authorization` section.

        <Frame caption={`enter your x-api-key in the authorization section`}>
          <img src="/images/voices/post-voice-authorization.png" alt="authorize post voice api" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="enter params">
        enter the params in the body section:

        <Frame caption={`
          enter the urls for your publicly accessible audio and video files into the respective fields and set other required parameters.
        `}>
          <img src="/images/voices/post-voice-body.png" alt="body params for post voice api" />
        </Frame>

        <h3>example input</h3>
        ```json
        {
          "name": "Example voice name",
          "description": "This is a description for the example voice.",
          "inputSamples": ["https://example.com/sample1.mp3"],
        }
        ```

        this example request outlines the basic structure for creating a voice clone.
      </Step>
      <Step title="submit">
        click the `Send` button to submit your request. after submission, you will receive a response that includes the `id` of your voice, the current status, and the details of the submission.

        <h3>understanding the response</h3>
        the initial response provides you with essential details to track your job:

        ```json
        {
          "id": "unique_job_id",
          "status": "processing",
          "name": "Example voice name",
          "description": "This is a description for the example voice.",
          "inputSamples": ["https://example.com/sample1.mp3"],
          "creditsDeducted": 123,
          "webhookUrl": null,
        }
        ```

        your job's `status` will start as `pending` and move to `processing`. use the returned `id` with the `GET /voices/{id}` endpoint to periodically poll for the status of your job. this polling is crucial for knowing when your video is ready.

        <h3>polling for completion</h3>
        periodically send requests to `GET /voices/{id}` with your job `id`. when the job status changes to `completed`, the response will include a URL to download your synced video.

        Click [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/endpoint/voices/get-voice#quick-start) to view instructions on polling for job completion with the [get voice api playground](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/endpoint/voices/get-voice)
