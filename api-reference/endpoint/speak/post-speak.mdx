# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## create your speak request

## translate your videos

now that you have an `x-api-key`, you can test out the `/speak` endpoint. to try out the speak endpoint via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/speak/post-speak) follow the instructions below:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="book" title="generate speech via the api playground">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="authorize">
        enter your api key in the `x-api-key` field within the `Authorization` section.

        <Frame caption={`enter your x-api-key in the authorization section`}>
          <img src="/images/speak/post-speak-authorization.png" alt="authorize translate api" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="enter params">
        enter the params in the body section:

        <Frame caption={`
        enter the video url, target language, and model in the body section
        `}>
          <img src="/images/speak/post-speak-body.png" alt="body params for translate api" />
        </Frame>
        <h3>example input</h3>
        ```json
        {
          "transcript": "Hello, I hope you enjoy this audio!",
          "targetLanguage": "e5361405-4967-446d-ad63-2f6ed8729c66", # default male voice
        }
        ```
      
      </Step>
        <Step title="submit">
        click the `Send` button to submit your speak request. after submission, you will receive a response that includes the `id` of your speak job, the current status, and details of the original submission.

        <h3>understanding the response</h3>
        the initial response provides you with essential details to track your job:

        ```json
        {
          "id": "unique_job_id",
          "status": "processing",
          "step": "synthesizing",
          "audioUrl": "",
          "transcriptUrl": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
          "voiceId": "e5361405-4967-446d-ad63-2f6ed8729c66",
          "creditsDeducted": 123,
        }
        ```

        your job's `status` will start as `pending` and move to `processing`. use the returned `id` with the `GET /speak/{id}` endpoint to periodically poll for the status of your job. this polling is crucial for knowing when your video is ready.

        <h3>polling for completion</h3>
        periodically send requests to `GET /speak/{id}` with your job `id`. when the job status changes to `completed`, the response will include a URL to download your synced video.

        Click [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/endpoint/speak/get-speak#quick-start) to view instructions on polling for job completion with the [get translate api playground](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/endpoint/speak/get-speak)
