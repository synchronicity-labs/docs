# introduction

before launching into speech synthesis, the `/speak/cost` endpoint can be used to estimate the cost. this helps with project planning, and to align expectations and budget allocations effectively.

# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## estimate your speech synthesis cost

equipped with your `x-api-key`, navigating the cost estimation for speech synthesis is effortless. to estimate the cost via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/speak/get-speak-cost) follow the instructions below:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="book" title="via the api playground">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="prepare your text or text file URL">
        ready either your text or the URL to a text file intended for speech generation. these details are essential for calculating the synthesis cost.

        enter the text or text file URL as a query parameter when submitting your request to the `/speak/cost` endpoint.

        <Frame caption={`gather your text or text file URL`}>

        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="review your estimate">
        upon submission, an estimate is provided, detailing the credits required to generate audio from your text. this assists in making informed decisions regarding the feasibility of your speech synthesis projects within available budgets.

        <Frame caption={`expect an estimated cost in the response`}>
          <img src="/images/speak/get-speak-cost-response.png" alt="reviewing the estimated cost" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
