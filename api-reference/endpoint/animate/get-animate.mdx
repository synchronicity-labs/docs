# introduction

after initiating an animation job, the `/animate/{id}` endpoint serves as your gateway to updates. use it to monitor the progress of your animation job and access the download URL for your animated video.

# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## track your animation projects

with an `x-api-key`, tracking the evolution of your animation projects becomes a straightforward task. to track the progress via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/animate/get-animate) follow the instructions below:

      <Step title="retrieve your job id">
        once you've submitted your video, transcript, and voiceId via the `/animate` endpoint, you'll be assigned a job `id`. this `id` is crucial for subsequent tracking.

        <Frame caption={`example response from the post /animate endpoint`}>
          <img src="/images/animate/post-animate-response.png" alt="response from post /animate endpoint" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="monitor job status">
        regularly query the `/animate/{id}` endpoint with your job `id` to stay informed about the status of your animation job.

        <Frame caption={`input your job id to track its progress.`}>
          <img src="/images/animate/get-animate-path.png" alt="path params for get animate api" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="access your animated video">
        upon reaching a `completed` status, the response will not only confirm the job's success but also provide a URL for downloading your video, now animated with tailored audio.

        <Frame caption={`the final response includes a download link for your video.`}>
