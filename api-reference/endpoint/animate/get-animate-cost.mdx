# introduction

before diving into animation, the `/animate/cost` endpoint offers a preliminary look at the cost involved. this step is crucial for planning and budgeting, ensuring you know how many credits the animation process will consume.

# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## estimate your animation cost

with your `x-api-key` ready, you can easily navigate the cost estimation for your animation projects. to estimate the cost via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/animate/get-animate-cost) follow the instructions below:

        ready your text for voiceover and the URL for the video you wish to animate. these elements are essential for assessing the cost of adding custom audio to your video.

        enter the text and video URL as query parameters when submitting your request to the `/animate/cost` endpoint.
