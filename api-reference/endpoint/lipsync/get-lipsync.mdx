# introduction

after submitting your video and audio for synchronization, use the `/lipsync/{id}` endpoint to monitor progress and retrieve your video.

stay updated on your job's status and get the final, generated video.

# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## track your lipsync videos

once you have your `x-api-key`, you're ready to start tracking the progress of your lipsync videos. to track your video via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/lipsync/get-lipsync) follow the instructions below:
