# introduction

before submitting a translation job, you can use the `/translate/cost` endpoint to get an estimate of the cost. this preliminary check is designed to set clear expectations and assist in efficient project management.

# quick start

## authentication
before you can start using our api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the instructions [here](https://docs.synclabs.so//api-reference/quickstart#generate-an-api-key) to obtain one.

## estimate your translation cost

with your `x-api-key` ready, you can estimate the cost for your translation job. to estimate the cost via the playground [above](/api-reference/endpoint/translate/get-translate-cost) follow the instructions below:

  <Accordion icon="book" title="via the api playground">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="prepare your video URL">
        ensure you have the URL for your publicly accessible video file ready. this URL is essential for calculating the translation and synchronization cost.

        enter the video URL as a query parameter when submitting your request to the `/translate/cost` endpoint.

        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="review your estimate">
        after submission, you'll receive an estimated cost for the translation and synchronization of your video. this crucial insight helps you gauge whether to proceed based on your credit balance and project budget.
