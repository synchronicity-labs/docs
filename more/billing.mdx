to manage your subscription, go to the [sync web app](https://app.synclabs.so/) navigate to the [subscription](https://app.synclabs.so/subscription) page and select the `manage subscription` button at the top right of the screen.

this will redirect you to a secure [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) hosted billing portal where you can update your payment information, view your billing history, and cancel your subscription.

## billing cycles

billing cycles are based on the date you first signed up for a subscription. For example, if you signed up on the 15th of the month, your billing cycle will renew on the 15th of each month.

## overage charges

if you exceed your monthly generation limit, you can continue to access the service by allowing overage charges.

this can be done by going to the [sync web app](https://app.synclabs.so/), navigating to the [Subscription](https://app.synclabs.so/subscription) page and toggling on the `allow overages` option under the `subscription` section.

when overages are enabled and you exceed your monthly generation limit, you will automatically be charged for `30 additional minutes of generation`.

you can disable overages at any time by toggling off the `allow overages` option.

## faqs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="is this a recurring payment?">
    yes, our billing cycle is monthly. you have the flexibility to cancel or update your subscription at any point without any additional fees, ensuring you are not locked into a long-term commitment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="what exactly are credits?">
    credits are the currency used within our platform, where one credit equates to one frame of video generation (i.e. a 1 minutes video at 25 fps would cost 1500 credits). Credits will automatically replenish every month, allowing you continuous access to our services.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="do credits rollover?">
    subscription credits expire at the end of each billing cycle and do not rollover. you'll receive a fresh set of subscription credits at the beginning of each new billing cycle.

    overage credits, however, will rollover to the next billing cycle only. any unused overage credits after that period will expire.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="canceling a subscription">
    you can cancel your subscription at any time by going to the [sync web app](https://app.synclabs.so/), navigating to the [subscription](https://app.synclabs.so/subscription) page and selecting the `manage subscription` button at the top right of the screen.
