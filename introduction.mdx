## how does it work?

at the core of our product we're building audio-visual models – 
generating video conditioned on a given audio.

all you need to do is:
1. submit an audio + video
2. we sync the video to the audio, **no training required**.
3. get back a lipsynced video → [future] stream video back as it processes

fundamentally, we split our platform into two main parts:
- **the playground:** create / experiment w/ a simple, intuitive UX
- **the api:** plug into your apps / services / businesses + scale w/ demand

### the playground
our playground is designed to be a simple way to try different models, play w/ parameters,
and build an intuition around which models work best for which use case.

we're optimizing for a simple UX + advanced configurability – you'll be able to generate
any piece of content w/ a suite of state of the art models
without ever having to see a single line of code (eg. no more google collabs).


### the api
our api is designed to be a simple way to integrate our models into your apps / platforms / services + scale
as your users / use case does.
