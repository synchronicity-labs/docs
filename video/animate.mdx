- **high-quality video:** ensure your video is of good quality, especially the clarity of the subjectsâ€™ faces, to facilitate accurate mouth movement animation.
- **choose the right voice:** experiment with different voices to find the one that best suits your video's character or narrative tone.
- **understand the model's capabilities:** familiarize yourself with the different models available to choose the best one for your video's requirements.

while our system is capable of handling a variety of languages and accents, selecting the appropriate voice and model is crucial for achieving the best synchronization between the generated audio and video lip movements.
