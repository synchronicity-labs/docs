## tips for optimal results
to maximize the effectiveness of translation, keep these points in mind:

- **audible audio:** ensure the speaker's voice in the video is loud and clear. Our translation tools require audible audio to accurately extract and translate the content.
- **single speaker:** our system is optimized for videos with a single speaker. This focus allows for more precise audio extraction and translation.
- **clean audio:** background noise can interfere with audio extraction. Videos with minimal background noise ensure a cleaner translation process.
- **consistent pacing:** a steady speech rate aids in the accuracy of translation. Rapid or inconsistent speech can result in translation challenges.
- **video quality:** just like with lip sync, a high-quality video supports better translation and lip synchronization.
