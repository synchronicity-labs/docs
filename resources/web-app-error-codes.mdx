## Web App Errors 
### Upload Error - RequestTimeTooSkewed

</Frame>

this bug has occured for some users running Windows 10 and is typically caused by a mismatch in your computers system time and the time on the AWS server.

one way you can check is by running the below in the terminal:

```bash
$ curl http://s3.amazonaws.com -v 
$ date -u 
```

the first command will return the time on the AWS server, and the second command will return the time on your computer. if the times are off by more than **15 minutes**, you'll need to resynchronize your system's clock to resolve the problem.

### Upload Error - NetworkingError
