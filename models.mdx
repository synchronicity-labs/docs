## lip-sync models at a glance
Step into the realm of sync., where our suite of lip-sync models is engineered to animate your videos with naturalistic lip movement, syncing audio to video effortlessly.

## capabilities of our models
- **universal fit:** models work with any spoken audio and any face, right away.
- **precision:** they specifically fine-tune the mouth area to sync with the audio, leaving the rest of the video untouched.

## model selection guide
### sync-1.5.1-beta
top-tier sync: our most advanced model for the highest sync accuracy and lifelike skin tones.
when to switch: if you notice issues with teeth appearance or mouth color, consider other models.
### sync-1.5.0
stable and tested: this version is our backbone, proven across a variety of videos.
why choose this: if the beta model doesn't meet your needs or you're moving up from an older model, this is your best bet.
### sync-1
legacy support: now surpassed by newer models, available via API, it automatically upgrades to sync 1.5.0 for better results.

## understanding model limitations
To get the most out of our models, here's what you should keep in mind:

- **face visibility:** if the face is hidden or turned away, the model won't sync that section.
- **single face focus:** our models currently sync one face at a time. In videos with multiple faces, they may not select the correct one.
- **forward-facing works best:** steep angles or side profiles can be tricky for our models.
- **resolution limit:** best results are seen with faces up to 512 pixels in size.
Knowing these points helps you align your video inputs with our model strengths for superior lip-sync results.
